Hey! ðŸ‘‹

If you ended up here is probably because you're looking for your own small space in the Software Engineering universe. \
Whether you are interested in creating a space with your thoughts, or you might have an interesting idea you decided to 
pursue, a `.software-engineer.space` domain might be exactly what you need.

## Getting a `.software-engineer.space` domain

## Supported use-cases

The only available service for the moment is the GitHub hosted website described above. \
If you have other scenarios or special request feel free to open an issue, I'd be happy to help and understand your
needs.

## Why are you doing this?
I was playing around with managing Cloudflare DNS via Terraform and I wanted a place where to store my configurations
and the obvious answer was GitHub. But why create repositories manually if I could have used Terraform for it as well? \
That's how the idea was born.

Speaking of the hype cycle I haven't probably reached yet the "peak of inflated expectations", so as far as I'm learning
I'm happy. \
The bubble will pop inevitably, but that'd still be learning, right?
